"""The review of a simulated pool's payout before anyone signs it through or stops it (docs/SIM-POOL.md).

It reads the chain and nothing else, sends nothing and holds no key. For each payout claimed
(`PayoutDue`) and still waiting it says:

  who and what     → the trader, the stage, the exam it came from, the amount, when it is due;
  pairs            → every fill of the stage and of the exam against every fill of every other account
                     of the factory's pools: the same asset, the other side, close in time and size
                     (`ops/sim_check.py`'s rule, the same parameters), with both fills' transactions;
  linked wallets   → senders of USDC to this trader who sent USDC to another buyer of the factory too,
                     and USDC sent between the two. The pools themselves pay every trader and are not
                     counted; a sender that funded more than --wide buyers is named but not counted,
                     as a wallet an exchange pays out of funds thousands of strangers;
  late fills       → how many blocks late the filler put this trader's fills (`late` of `Filled`)
                     against everyone else's;
  the group's code → whose code the exam was bought under, its sales, from how many wallets, the
                     longest run of sales in a row under it each from a new wallet, and how many of its
                     buyers never traded or stand in a pair;
  what is running  → exams and stages still able to pass, the payouts they would be if all passed, and
                     whether the pool's free money covers them;
  the verdict      → "clean", or "suspicious" with its reasons, and the call to sign, as text only: a
                     stop (`stopPayout`, reason 1 or 2, only with a pair) or the approval
                     (`approvePayouts`). A stop of reason 3, a result disputed without a pair, needs a
                     written analysis this script does not make.

What it does not see, by its nature: a pair on another factory or another venue, accounts the
trader holds under wallets nothing links, and USDC that came from before the deployment's block.
Testnet only.
